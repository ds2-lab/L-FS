/**
 * Generic interface defining the API of the EventManager.
 *
 * This interface is specifically designed to be used with MySQL Cluster NDB, but theoretically
 * this interface could be implemented to work with Redis (for example).
 *
 * Concrete implementations of this class are expected to interface with some sort of caching mechanism. This
 * caching mechanism is responsible for managing the cache on the NameNode.
 *
 * The EventManager simply informs the cache that its data is out of date (i.e., it has been invalidated), and thus
 * it must be updated.
 *
 * The EventManager is expected to run as its own thread so that listening for events does not block other threads.
 * As such, it extends Runnable so that subclasses implement their own Run method.
